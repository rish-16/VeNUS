# VeNUS
Version control for your NUSMods timetable

## What is it?
Selecting modules is a time-consuming task. With so many possible timings and combinations of mods to choose from, it becomes difficult to maintain a singular source of truth.

[NUSMods](http://nusmods.com), the primary source for building timetables, is limited in functionality by letting students only have one final timetable in view at all times. `VeNUS` hopes to solve that problem by letting you create different versions of your timetable, with different combination of mods (the same or completely different), and letting you see all of them at one glance.

It's great when you *need* to have backup plans for your backup plans. No more having 10+ mods on your timetable under the pretense of "planning" ever again!

## Inspiration
ModReg period is hell for most NUS students, especially when plans don't work out and we're forced to fall back on Plan Bs and alternative classes for the incoming semester.

`VeNUS` was inspired by a friend's Instagram story showcasing their NUSMods timetable. It had a lot of mods stuffed into the NUSMods timetable widget with lots of clashes and ~45MCs worth of classes on it at the same time. Surely they were planning and choosing between multiple timetables, right?

That's the exact problem `VeNUS` tries to solve.

## Naming
The `Ve` comes from **Ve**rsion Control (like `git`) and `NUS` stands for the National University of Singapore. Funky, isn't it?
